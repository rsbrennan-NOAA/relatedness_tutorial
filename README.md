A brief tutorial with background to calculate kinship/relatedness. 

The approach here uses the [Waples et al](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14954) approach via (NgsRelate)[https://github.com/ANGSD/NgsRelate]. Note that much of this document is theoretical background, jump to `Calculating relatedness` section to get to the actual doing.
